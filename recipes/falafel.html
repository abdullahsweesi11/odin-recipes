    <h3>Prepare to indulge in a heart-warming Middle-Eastern staple</h3>
    <p>Falafel (sometimes spelt felafel) is a popular Middle Eastern dish. These compact deep-fried patties are a common street food and may be found in places like Syria, Egypt, and Palestine, whose national cuisine is falafel. It is regarded as one of the most well-known and beloved foods from that region of the world and is a valued staple for vegetarians.</p>
    <p>Falafel's main ingredients are garbanzo beans (chickpeas) or a combination of garbanzo beans and peeled fava beans. Before deep frying, the cooked beans are crushed into a coarse paste and combined with the other ingredients. The patties are frequently bound with ingredients like flour, breadcrumbs, or eggs to help them maintain their shape. Although the preferred spices differ from household to household, cumin, garlic, parsley, onion, or cilantro are frequently used as falafel additions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried chickpeas (Do NOT use canned or cooked chickpeas)</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh parsley leaves, stems removed</li>
        <li>¾ cup fresh cilantro leaves, stems removed</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh dill, stems removed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, quartered</li>
        <li>7-8 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper, optional</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>(One day in advance) Place the dried chickpeas and baking soda in a large bowl filled with water to cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches. Soak overnight for 18 hours (longer  if the chickpeas are still too hard). When ready, drain the chickpeas completely and pat them dry.</li>
    <li>Add the chickpeas, herbs, onions, garlic and spices to the large bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade. Run the food processor 40 seconds at a time until all is well combined forming a the falafel mixture.</li>
    <li>Transfer the falafel mixture to a container and cover tightly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or (up to one whole night) until ready to cook.</li>
    <li>Just before frying, add the baking powder and sesame seeds to the falafel mixture and stir with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Scoop tablespoonfuls of the falafel mixture and form into patties (½ inch in thickness each). It helps to have wet hands as you form the patties.</li>
    <li>Fill a medium saucepan 3 inches up with oil. Heat the oil on medium-high until it bubbles softly. Carefully drop the falafel patties in the oil, let them fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or so until crispy and medium brown on the outside. Avoid crowding the falafel in the saucepan, fry them in batches if necessary.</li>
    <li>Place the fried falafel patties in a colander or plate lined with paper towels to drain.</li>
    <li>Serve falafel hot next to other small plates; or assemble the falafel patties in pita bread with tahini or hummus, arugula, tomato and cucumbers. Enjoy!</li>
